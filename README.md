# RazorPagesMovie
An ASP.NET core 2 application

This is an application for managing movies. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database of movie information.
This application uses code-first migrations via the entity framework. It makes working with db's really easy for programmers!

In crafting this application I've come to appreciate all of the useful features that the .NET framework offers for creatng applications like this one.
